# TFHE

`TFHE.jl` is a Julia port of:

* TFHE (https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe), based on I. Chillotti, N. Gama, M. Georgieva, and M. Izabach√®ne, "Faster Fully Homomorphic Encryption: Bootstrapping in Less Than 0.1 Seconds";
* MKFTHE (https://github.com/ilachill/MK-TFHE), based on H. Chen, I. Chillotti, and Y. Song, "Multi-Key Homomophic Encryption from TFHE".

The implementation if focused primarily on clarity and conciseness, not on performance.
